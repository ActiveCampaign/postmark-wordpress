1. Upload postmark directory to your /wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate plugin in WordPress admin
3. In WordPress admin, go to Settings then Postmark. You will then want to insert your Postmark details. If you don't already have a Postmark account, get one at http://postmarkapp.com
4. Verify sending by entering a recipient email address you have access to and pressing the "Send Test Email" button.
5. Once verified, then check "Enable" to override wp_mail and send using Postmark instead.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Postmark? =

Postmark is a hosted service that expertly handles all delivery of transactional webapp and web site email. This includes welcome emails, password resets, comment notifications, and more. If you've ever installed WordPress and had issues with PHP's mail() function not working right, or your WordPress install sends comment notifications or password resets to spam, Postmark makes all of these problems vanish in seconds. Without Postmark, you may not even know you're having delivery problems. Find out in seconds by installing and configuring this plugin.

= Will this plugin work with my WordPress site? =

The Postmark for WordPress plugin overrides any usage of the wp_mail() function. Because of this, if any 3rd party code or plugins send mail directly using the PHP mail function, or any other method, we cannot override it. Please contact the makers of any offending plugins and let them know that they should use wp_mail() instead of unsupported mailing funcitons.

= Does this cost me money? =

This Postmark plugin is 100% free. All new Postmark accounts include 25,000 free credits. Afterwards, they will cost only $1.50 per 1000 sends with no monthly commitments and no expirations.

We will send you multiple warnings as you approach running out of send credits, so you don't need to worry about paying for credits until you absolutely need them.

A solid infrastructure only goes so far, that’s why improving our customer’s sending practices helps achieve incredible results

= Why aren't my HTML emails being sent? =

This plugin detects HTML by checking the headers sent by other WordPress plugins. If a "text/html" content type isn't set then this plugin won't send the HTML to Postmark to be sent out only the plain text version of the email.
